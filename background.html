                        <li>MACA is one of a kind tutoring academy that was incorporated to be a solution to some of the short falls that are experienced in maintream schooling. It was grounded to be an interection of education and technology to enhance the quality of content management and delivery in the classroom to improve conditions of student participation and pass rate for the current mainstream schooling.</li><br>
                        <li>Mainstream schooling faces a structural challenge of overcrowding in the classroom. Overcrowding exponentially compromises the quality of content management, delivery and student feedback and performance. At best the number of students per classroom is between 20 and 25 students per session. Yet the number of students in mainstream schooling ranges from 60 to 98 learners per classroom in a 48 minute lesson, with one teacher. With such conditions, how can a teacher deliver content effectively to make sure that each learner fully engages and participates? How can a teacher effectively track student participation and performance? How can a teacher ensure that each and every learner receives the close and personalised attention that they need?</li><br>
                        <li>At MACA we target a maximum of 15 students per lesson. Our small classes allow us to effectively delivery content making that each student is thoroughly engaged and stimulated to effectvely participate. We frequently mark and track our students' performance in every activity that they do, to ensure they keep up with the highest standards of expectations when they return to their respective mainstream schools.</li>
